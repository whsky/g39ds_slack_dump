I want to know how this works in the KNN euclidean distance function. ``` np.sqrt(np.dot(a-b, a-b)) ``` So say like in our assignment you have an array thats (100,4) = a and we pass in a single point thats (4,1) = b . Python says I can't do this and I am not sure why. We are dealing with 4 dimensional space right? so a single point has to have 4 parameters. So confused on how this is actually working and having a hard time even testing it in Ipython. Thanks, have a good night.",
