I just added all of you (except for <@U3GKBMBPS> who is not present in learn yet for reasons i am not totally clear on) as students to an assessment we are developing. \n<https://learn.galvanize.com/content/gSchool/BAH_assessment/master/test_1.md> \nif you could take that test sometime in the next week or so I would really appreciate it. We are trying to get some signal as to where the tests stands as an assessment tool, so try to treat it seriously. We anticipate it should take 1-2 hours, please try to do it in as few sittings as possible, but I understand you are all busy.\nIf you have any feedback about the questions or interface feel free to let me know.
