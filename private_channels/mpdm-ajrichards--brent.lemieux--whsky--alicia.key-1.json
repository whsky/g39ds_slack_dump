So from 8:25 to 8:30 I did a demo with Seaborn using `sns.pairplot(data=df)` and `sns.pairplot(data=df[['quality', 'citric acid', 'residual sugar']])`. They had fun with that, as we looked at the data so quickly, and we found that high quality wine in the dataset has low residual sugar. I will get my lecture materials to you for review by Monday for the day 11 lecture.",
