We do not own it, but we have leased some spaces, and if you would like to purchase a space, you can contact the Galvanize Membership Manager, Jake Phillips: <mailto:jake.phillips@galvanize.com|jake.phillips@galvanize.com> - we charge the same $220 per month that LAZ Parking charges us - we just tend to be more responsive than are they.\n\notherwise, i recommend using public transit, biking (we have free secure bike storage!), or an app that will help you find a parking subscription, like Best Parking: <http://www.bestparking.com/austin-parking/monthly-parking/>",
