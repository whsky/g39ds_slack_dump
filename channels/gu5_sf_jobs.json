I have professional experience as an actuarial analyst and as a programmer in the health insurance and financial industries, respectively. I\u2019ve acquired knowledge in machine learning applications, natural language processing, and data engineering. I am familiar with supervised regression and classification techniques, as well as unsupervised techniques such as clustering and Non negative factorization. In my latest project, I used the presidential debate text to train a Naive Bayes classifier that can classify statements to a specific candidate.\n\nBefore I entered the field of data science, I was a programmer for a fortune 500 Financial Services company. Hired on with almost zero programming knowledge, within two years I became a subject matter expert on a data pipeline application. This application transformed VSAM (mainframe) datasets to a relational database that then integrated with a BI reporting tool. As a SME for this application, I was not only responsible for developing custom implementations, but I was also responsible for developing project outlines, estimates, timelines, and planning documents for full software deployment.\n\nMy programming language of choice is Python, where I frequently use numpy, pandas, scikit-learn, nltk, and matplotlib.

In short,  you have all indicated an interest in this visit, here is a summary of what I\u2019ve learned\n\n1)\tIt is possible to get a job placement in Austin (or the State of Texas through the contacts made by the Austin location) by the nature Galvanize\u2019s national presence.   To do so however, we must strictly go through MaryAnn and not through the local Office of interest.\n2)\tGalvanize jobs board &amp; job placement is centered on a specific site where we post our profiles, a site that Galvanize curates \u2013 which we will find out from MaryAnn at some point in the future.\n3)\tOur idea that we discussed prior to my trip \u2013 where we can get a company outside of SF, to consider gU5 students for an internship or capstone -- is currently not a reality for the entire Galvanize national network at this time.  This was made clear during my Austin visit.  \n4)\tHowever, if we are all still interested in such a capstone /internship for ourselves or most likely as an option for future cohorts we may want to mention in our upcoming career service meetings with MaryAnn.\n\nI had a great and highly productive trip, and am happy to share what I learned with you. \n\tRafa",

Their contributions can impact departments across product, marketing, design, operations, and beyond. But in order for innovative businesses to grow and build excellent products, companies must understand the different applications and values behind each discipline. For this March\u2019s Super Office Hours event, Twitch and Mixpanel join forces in a Fireside Chat to discuss why data science and machine learning are two of the most important practices to invest in for company growth. Danny Hernandez, Data Scientist at Twitch, and Jenny Finkel, Head of Machine Learning at Mixpanel, examine how companies use these superpowers to leverage data in more sophisticated ways and build products that win. In this conversation, moderated by Amelia Salyers, Editor of Mixpanel's The Signal, Danny and Jenny will break down the complex concepts of data science and machine learning to help us understand exactly why these two fields will build empires in the new era of technology.",
