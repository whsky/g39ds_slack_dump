How did you divide up the work, like frontend/backend? What is your git workflow?\n--If you could go back and start the project over, what would you do differently (like in terms of schema design, and components)?\n--How do you handle data validation on the front end/ backend, and how do you manage that as a user goes through the long form to populate the dashboard?\n--How would you rollout permissions with admin roles for users?\n--What was your biggest technical challenge, and how did you solve it? \n--How do you test a long workflow--between backend components, and between backend and frontend, etc. \n--Caching validation. How do you know when to stop relying on your cache, and go back to the backend?\n--What are the bottlenecks in your current design that you might want to pass on to future contributors?\n--How would you improve the UI to reduce it being so form and table-heavy?

At 9:00, please continue your work on the TDD problem you have been working on. Give yourself an upper limit of 10:00. I will be releasing solution code and if the class is interested, a video of my process going through the problem, later today.\n\nAt 10, take a little break and then get in your teams and jump back in on the sprint 2 requirements. Many of you had questions about Git Work flow yesterday. I'm going to put together a screencast that I think you will find very helpful and will provide you with that shortly. Also, I have reason to believe that <@U4WK6BJQM> and <@U4SCDGADR> both get it rather well, so I would encourage you to go to them for support so that they can also practice teaching.\n\nNext steps in the project (after the completion of sprint 2) will be added to the README before 10, so as soon as you're ready you can jump back into work.\n\nPlease slack me if you need anything at all, I'll be largely available until this afternoon when I'll be meeting up with the 42ers for graduation fun.",

The KISS principle states that most systems work best if they are kept simple rather than made complicated; therefore simplicity should be a key goal in design and unnecessary complexity should be avoided. The phrase has been associated with aircraft engineer Kelly Johnson (1910\u20131990). The term \"KISS principle\" was in popular use by 1970. Variations on the phrase include \"Keep it Simple, Silly\", \"keep it short and simple\", \"keep it simple and straightforward\" and \"keep it small and simple\".",

If you didn't get a chance to read the message I sent out to the channel yesterday afternoon, please do check it out since it has some information relevant to your work on Bookshelf today.\n\nAt 1:00 pm I'd like for you to complete work on your refactored Queue class (that uses 2 stack instances as a storage). Please remember to treat your stack instances as if you have no idea what the internal implementation details for them are. This means you will only be able to use the available methods on them like `push` `pop` and `size`, and not do things with it like look up its underlying storage array. To make clear, this is not the sort of thing you would be finding yourself doing in a real life situation, but, it is just the kind of question that you might get in an interview and for good reason. This problem requires that you have knowledge of some fundamental data structures, it requires you understand the limitations of a given data structures API, and to actually solve about the problem, requires some planning and a bit of thinking outside of the box.\n\nI've had conversations with a couple of you on this problem (as well as some others), and I think there are some takeaways from those conversations that I would like to share with the entire class. With that in mind I'll  put together a screen cast of working through this particular problem and share it with y'all to be watched at your leisure. Do please work on the problem yourself though as it is only through the activity of doing the work that you will make meaningful improvements.\n\nAlso I am totally here for y'all until this afternoon's meetings, so, please don't be shy about pinging me just cause I'm remote today. It's really easy to set up a hangout and to work together as needed.",

I'll be working from home tomorrow. <@U1ZLU4QQ2> is going to handle the warmups with y'all at 9:00 and will be facilitating y'all's first Pull Request! Afterwards he'll be delivering a lesson on an important server side concept: cookies.\n\nCookies have a lot of different use cases. <@U1ZLU4QQ2> will be addressing both the way that they are used in the Bookshelf assignment, and, some other ways to use cookies that you might see in the wild, but not in Bookshelf proper. You should strive to understand the content in the lesson enough to meet the objectives <@U1ZLU4QQ2> defines, but don't feel like you need to do additionally building beyond what you do in the Bookshelf assignment and <@U1ZLU4QQ2>'s lesson itself.\n\nSpeaking of Bookshelf, tomorrow you all will be implementing some routes in the Bookshelf app to handle user registration and authentication. In order to do this you will need to utilize the `bcrypt` library that we spoke so extensively about yesterday. You can and should use the `bcrypt` docs, and also might find helpful to review the slides from yesterday (see links below).\n\n*There are upstream changes to the galvanize-bookshelf repo!*. These changes remove a now unnecessary library `bcrypt-as-promised` because the actual `bcrypt` library itself now supports promises by itself. You will need to pull from upstream should you wish to have this new change, and then, rerun `npm install` to install the new dependency. You got this.\n\n<https://github.com/kelektiv/node.bcrypt.js>\n<https://docs.google.com/a/galvanize.com/presentation/d/1ZdtRJX1y-IxwVsVPEvziY2TGiOF59OW8SJrDm3y3XUo/edit?usp=sharing>",

I'm really happy I had the chance to jump back into these projects briefly to remember just what good work you all did.\n\nThe way that I am doing the code review is to record screencasts of going through your codebases, so, I am also in the process of compressing the files and will then be uploading them as unlisted vids in youtube. After the vids are up in youtube I will provide links to them in the Learn submission section, and will also slack the links out to you individually.\n\nI'll be going for about another hour so if there's anything you need please do let me know.\n\nAll the best.",

Be sure to note the differences between project specific linting and setting up global linting: <http://eslint.org/docs/user-guide/getting-started>\n\nHere is the atom package (if you don't already have something similar) so that atom will keep you alert, as you're coding, about whether or not your code smells: <https://atom.io/packages/linter-eslint>\n\nThis tutorial covers the same topics and also shows how to integrate the airbnb style guide rules into your linting. The airbnb style guide is currently a very popular style guide to follow: <http://www.acuriousanimal.com/2016/08/14/configuring-atom-with-eslint.html>",

I recommend starting with the introduction and going through the whole thing, you'll learn a ton about how JavaScript works and will also most likely do a lot of learning consolidation: <https://hacks.mozilla.org/category/es6-in-depth/page/2/>\n\n_JavaScript Allong\u00e9 The Six Edition_ which you can get a mondo one page free version of here. It's a great dive into functional programming and I think is super helpful in terms of gaining JS function mastery. <https://leanpub.com/javascriptallongesix/read>\n\nThe CryptoPals Challenges. Very fun introduction to cryptography that will also force you to write some really clever code. It has a learning curve if you've never done anything with hex strings of buffers, but JavaScript has all the tools you need for it and if at all you like feeling like a hacker, I can't recommend the challenges enough: <http://cryptopals.com/sets/1>\n\nProject ROSALIND: a very cool set of bioinformatics coding challenges that can be done in any language: <http://rosalind.info/about/>\n\nThat video on the JS Event Loop is totally worth watching again: <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGhZQkoFbQ&amp;t=682s>\n\nAnd if you're still dreaming of the front end, there's nothing wrong with the React Tutorial, written by one of my heroes, Dan Abramov: <https://facebook.github.io/react/tutorial/tutorial.html>\n\nReviewing the following repos would also be a great use of time if you're in the mood for reviewing:\n\n<https://github.com/joshwyatt/passing-functions-as-arguments>\n<https://github.com/joshwyatt/higher>\n<https://github.com/joshwyatt/classes>",

Google appears to be taking action to stop it, but in the mean time: be super, super wary of Google Doc invites for now. If you fall for this one (and plenty of otherwise eagle-eyed people have already), it&rsquo;ll blast out the bait to everyone on your contact list.\nHere&rsquo;s what you need to know:\nClicking the link takes you to a real Google-hosted page, with a list of your Google accounts ready to click\nIt asks you to select an account and provide an app called &ldquo;Google Docs&rdquo; &mdash; yes, they were somehow allowed to name a third party app &ldquo;Google Docs&rdquo; &mdash; with account permissions\nAs soon as you click the &ldquo;allow&rdquo; button, this not-at-all-actually-Google Docs app now has permission to read your emails and email all your contacts&hellip;. the latter of which it&rsquo;ll start doing pretty much immediately, spreading the worm to pretty much everyone you&rsquo;ve ever emailed.\nThis one is super sneaky; pretty much the only way to detect it before falling for it is to click the small &ldquo;Google Docs&rdquo; link  on the actual Google-hosted page and notice that the developer info seems&hellip; off.\nZach Latta of Hack Club grabbed a video of the whole flow so you don&rsquo;t have to test fate to see it for yourself:\n\n\n@zeynep Just got this as well. Super sophisticated. \n&mdash; Zach Latta (@zachlatta) May 3, 2017\n\nHow do I know if I&rsquo;ve been hit? How do I fix it?\nCheck your Google account&rsquo;s app permissions.

He's one of my article writing heroes. For those of you who are particularly interested in learning the nuances of the language, even above and beyond what you need to use it well, I highly recommend taking your time to read through these articles, maybe even more than once. They don't need to be read in order necessarily, and the articles do a good job of pointing out where others should be read first, however, I think reading them starting at the Introduction is probably best.\n\n<https://hacks.mozilla.org/2015/04/es6-in-depth-an-introduction/>\n<https://hacks.mozilla.org/category/es6-in-depth/page/2/>",

A common question is, \u201caren\u2019t these just little details that don\u2019t really matter?\u201d The answer is yes and no. Yes, code style doesn\u2019t really matter to the computer that\u2019s running it; no, the little details matter a lot to the developers who have to maintain the code. Think of it this way: a single typo in a book doesn\u2019t disrupt your understanding or enjoyment of the story. However, if there are a lot of typos, the reading experience quickly becomes annoying as you try to decipher the author\u2019s meaning despite the words being used.\n\n&gt; Coding style is a lot like that. You are defining the equivalent of spelling and grammar rules for everyone to follow. Your style guide can get quite long and detailed, depending on which aspects of the language you want to focus on. In my experience, once teams get started on coding style guides, they tend to go into more and more detail because it helps them organize and understand the code they already have.",

His name was Dr. Maxey and he taught the more complicated courses like data structures and computer architecture. He was a wonderful teacher with a talent for articulating difficult concepts, but also an extremely tough grader. Not only would he look over your code to make sure that it worked, he would take off points for stylistic issues. If you were missing appropriate comments, or even if you misspelled a word or two in your comments, he would deduct points. If your code was \u201cmessy\u201d (by his standards), he would deduct points. The message was clear: the quality of your code is not just in its execution but also in its appearance. That was my first experience with coding style.",

For example, hoisting teaches that variable and function declarations are physically moved to the top of your coding, but this is not what happens at all. What does happen is that variable and function\u00a0declarations are put into memory during the compile phase, but stays exactly where you typed it in your coding.",

Terse code has tradeoffs. On the one hand, it allows writers to write less and have less cluttered code base. On the other hand, readers have to parse out the terse code, which can make their work more difficult. You must learn through experience how to weigh tradeoffs such as these.\n\nLater in your learning you will find there are situations where you are only allowed to write _expressions_, and *not* _statements_. In situations like this, you can write an expression that uses a ternary operator to handle some conditional logic, even though you are forbidden from using an `if` _statement_. For example, you just learned about `for` loops and about how as a part of the looping mechanism there is an _incrementing expression_. What if you wanted to provide some conditional logic here? Since an _expression_ is required, you cannot use an `if` statement, but, you could use an expression containing a `ternary` operator. Here's a convoluted example. Try it out in the console and make sure you understand why it works, and also, why you could *not* do it with an `if` statement:\n\n```\nfor(var i = 0; i &lt; 20; i % 2 === 0 ? i += 1 : i += 3) {\n    console.log(i)\n}\n````",

I was looking for some guidance on how best to never miss important lectures or pairing sessions while still taking care of my toof(s).
