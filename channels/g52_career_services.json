Google appears to be taking action to stop it, but in the mean time: be super, super wary of Google Doc invites for now. If you fall for this one (and plenty of otherwise eagle-eyed people have already), it&rsquo;ll blast out the bait to everyone on your contact list.\nHere&rsquo;s what you need to know:\nClicking the link takes you to a real Google-hosted page, with a list of your Google accounts ready to click\nIt asks you to select an account and provide an app called &ldquo;Google Docs&rdquo; &mdash; yes, they were somehow allowed to name a third party app &ldquo;Google Docs&rdquo; &mdash; with account permissions\nAs soon as you click the &ldquo;allow&rdquo; button, this not-at-all-actually-Google Docs app now has permission to read your emails and email all your contacts&hellip;. the latter of which it&rsquo;ll start doing pretty much immediately, spreading the worm to pretty much everyone you&rsquo;ve ever emailed.\nThis one is super sneaky; pretty much the only way to detect it before falling for it is to click the small &ldquo;Google Docs&rdquo; link  on the actual Google-hosted page and notice that the developer info seems&hellip; off.\nZach Latta of Hack Club grabbed a video of the whole flow so you don&rsquo;t have to test fate to see it for yourself:\n\n\n@zeynep Just got this as well. Super sophisticated. \n&mdash; Zach Latta (@zachlatta) May 3, 2017\n\nHow do I know if I&rsquo;ve been hit? How do I fix it?\nCheck your Google account&rsquo;s app permissions. There should not be an app called &ldquo;Google Docs&rdquo; there &mdash; actual Google Docs has access to your account by default. If you see it listed there, remove it by tapping the label and hitting &ldquo;Remove&rdquo;\nUpdate: The Google Docs twitter account just acknowledged the attack and says they&rsquo;re working on it, but says not to click on things in the meantime.\n\n\nWe are investigating a phishing email that appears as Google Docs. We encourage you to not click through &amp; report as phishing within Gmail.\n&mdash; Google Docs (@googledocs) May 3, 2017\n\nStory developing&hellip;",
