Please have your presentation sketched out pretty well for us to take a quick look at that time. Keep in mind some principles for constructing good slides: Fonts should be large enough to read easily from the back of the room, including the labels and axis tick labels for your plots. This will help you to follow the second guideline which is that you should only use a few bullet points on each slide - the audience should be listening to you not reading your slides. Consider Guy Kawasaki's 10/20/30 rule - <http://guykawasaki.com/the_102030_rule/> and you will probably want fewer than 10 slides since you only have 3 minutes. This relates to the following quote from Steve Jobs:  \u201cThis is a very complicated world, it's a very noisy world. And we're not going to get the chance to get people to remember much about us... So we have to be really clear on what we want them to know about us.\"",
