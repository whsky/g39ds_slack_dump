Recognizing that women are significantly underfunded by current models, she launched SheEO in 2015 to take advantage of women\u2019s economic and social power to radically transform the landscape for women entrepreneurs by raising a billion dollars of capital by 2020 through individual women committing $1,000 each.\n\nThis event is open to the public, and I would love it if you could join and promote through your channels.  We hosted a SheEO event two weeks ago, it was amazing and brought some very smart, driven, and determined women into Galvanize.\n\n<https://www.eventbrite.ca/e/the-changing-face-of-funding-with-sheeo-founder-vicki-saunders-tickets-29723816736>",
