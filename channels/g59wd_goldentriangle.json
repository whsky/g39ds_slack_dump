Please complete your prework in Learn instead of GitHub. In order to access Learn, you\u2019ll need to accept the invite which is sent via email after you\u2019ve signed your contract. The pre-course cohort name in Learn is 17-01-WD-OL-PC (aka WDI Precourse). If you are having access issues, please email <mailto:softwaresupport@galvanize.com|softwaresupport@galvanize.com> with a detailed description. You\u2019ll still use GitHub throughout the program so it\u2019s good to be on there now too. Post any questions here or feel free to DM myself or <@U1US75J13> :slightly_smiling_face:",
