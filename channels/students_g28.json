This is a 12 ounce clear glass mason jar with gold tone lid. The candle weighs over a pound. The jar is 4 1/2 inches (12 cm) tall. Approximately 70-80 hours burn time. I put the label on the lid only so you can enjoy your candle burning through the clear glass. Your jar also comes with a pretty hang tag describing the scent with a pretty gold cord and bow making it perfect for gift giving. The wicking I use is a cotton/paper blend which is supposed to be self trimming, however, its always best to keep the wick trimmed to no more than a quarter inch and keep the wick centered in the jar for the best burning. My candles are highly scented and throw the scent well both lit and unlit.",
