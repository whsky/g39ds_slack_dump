At Cambridge, she developed optical elements to generate and manipulate light that would enable the human beings to see beyond the visible spectrum. At IBM Research, she developed machine vision algorithms to process multimodal images. Currently, she is the co-founder of <http://commerce.ai|commerce.ai> leading the development of a SaaS platform powered by natural language processing and machine learning.\u201d\n*Abstract*: The expectations from data scientists at startups (with teams of size 4-20) is often very different from that of mid to large size companies. Startups present an exciting opportunity to solve challenging problems and create a direct impact on the company. From the perspective of the data scientist, it is a unique opportunity to learn, grow and become a leader in the field. Very often the demands of the startup require not just a data scientist who is great at crunching numbers, but a person with the initiative and the vision to see the projects end to end. In my talk, I will discuss the key skills that early stage startups lookout for while hiring their first few team members",
