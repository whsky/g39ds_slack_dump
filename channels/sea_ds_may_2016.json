                    "text": "Workshop Topic: Storytelling for Startups As an emerging business, there\u2019s no shortage of advice when it comes to preparing an investor pitch. From the table of contents and the number of slides to selecting the most effective pie-charts, there are thousands of examples and templates to choose from online. And they all make the same recommendation: Make your story interesting. It is your story that sets you apart. It is what ultimately draws in an investor, appeals to a prospective employee or resonates with your friends and family. It connects them with your business and allows them to see themselves in your story. Many people believe that telling a story is natural, a no-brainer. Truth be told, for most of us, it's talking about an innovative idea or unique technology that is easy. Creating a compelling storyline is hard. When asked those four little words \u2014\u201ctell me your story\u201d\u2014most people seize up. This workshop will focus on methodologies and strategies for discovering the essential value that your product or service delivers to customers. Building on this, you will learn to create a smart storyline that will communicate this value to investors, potential employees and friends and family in a way that is personal, impactful and grabs attention. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Janinne Brunyee Jannine is deft at working across technologies and verticals, she has a breadth of marketing experience and has a simple recipe for success: To be seen, to be heard and\u2014most importantly\u2014to make a lasting imprint.\u00a0Jacqueline KochJacqueline draws from a background in journalism and non-profit communications to create the content and surround sound that sparks conversations and raises visibility and awareness.\u00a0Christopher RossChristopher has over 25 years of business experience helping a diverse array of organizations take their ideas from ideation to market, with an expertise and passion in operations and brand marketing.",

Algorithms are the heart of computer science, and the subject has countless practical applications as well as intellectual depth. This course is an introduction to algorithms for learners with at least a little programming experience. The course is rigorous but emphasizes the big picture and conceptual understanding over low-level implementation and mathematical details. After completing this course, you will be well-positioned to ace your technical interviews and speak fluently about algorithms with other programmers and computer scientists. Specific topics include: \"Big-oh\" notation, sorting and searching, divide and conquer (master method, integer and matrix multiplication, closest pair), randomized algorithms (QuickSort, contraction algorithm for min cuts), data structures (heaps, balanced search trees, hash tables, bloom filters), graph primitives (applications of BFS and DFS, connectivity, shortest paths). About the instructor: Tim Roughgarden has been a professor in the Computer Science Department at Stanford University since 2004. He has taught and published extensively on the subject of algorithms and their applications. Take free online classes from 140+ top universities and educational organizations. We partner with schools like Stanford, Yale, Princeton, and others to offer courses in dozens of topics, from computer science to teaching and beyond. Whether you are pursuing a passion or looking to advance your career, Coursera provides open, free education for everyone.",

Email <mailto:lkincaid@uber.com|lkincaid@uber.com>\u00a0with questions.Keynote abstract: There are five main schools of thought in machine learning,and each has its own master algorithm \u2013 a general-purpose learner that\u00a0can in principle be applied to any domain. The symbolists have inverse\u00a0deduction, the connectionists have backpropagation, the evolutionaries\u00a0have genetic programming, the Bayesians have probabilistic inference,\u00a0and the analogizers have support vector machines. What we really need,\u00a0however, is a single algorithm combining the key features of all of\u00a0them. In this talk I will describe my work toward this goal, including\u00a0in particular Markov logic networks, and speculate on the new\u00a0applications that such a universal learner will enable, and how\u00a0society will change as a result.Pedro Domingos is a professor of the Department of Computer Science &amp; Engineering at the University of Washington.\u00a0He is a winner of the SIGKDD Innovation Award, the highest honor in data science, a AAAI Fellow, and a recipient of a Sloan Fellowship, a NSF CAREER Award, a Fulbright Scholarship, an IBM Faculty Award, several best paper awards, and other distinctions. He is a member of the editorial board of the Machine Learning journal, co-founder of the International Machine Learning Society, and past associate editor of JAIR. He was program co chair of KDD-2003 and SRL-2009, and he has served on the program committees of AAAI, ICML, IJCAI, KDD, NIPS, SIGMOD, UAI, WWW, and others.",
