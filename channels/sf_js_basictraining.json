In fact, the github repo largely powers the LMS content. \n\nfor 2, it depends a little bit, but typically you're added to the read-allowed list of students after you sign your contract. If that describes your situation then I would email the admissions officer that you've been in contact with and ask them to grant you access to the precourse work. your problem sounds a little more unique than that... \n\nAm I correct in saying that you've been added to the LMS and can see some of the precourse work, but cannot download files that are linked within the LMS precourse?",

Super helpful and much appreciated!\n \nJust two quick questions about the pre-course web development work:\n\n1 - I see pre-course work on both the Learn LMS and in the Git repo that was linked to in the welcome email. Do they overlap? Or if not, should one be completed before the other?\n \n2 - On the Learn LMS side of things, there are a number of activities that require downloading files\u2026 but the links take me to a 404 page on Github. Is this an issue with the links, or is it still too early to have access to those files. Here\u2019s an example of one of the links: <https://github.com/gSchool/workshop-web-design-basics/blob/master/04-Github-Basics/2-Github-Setup/projects/pizza.zip?raw=true> (FYI, I\u2019ve accepted my invite to the Galvanize SFDC inc. on Github)",

Because I am also teaching here at Galvanize currently, you may find my responses to take up to a business day, but at other times you will find me very fast to respond.\n\nAlso, I hope that conversations amongst all of you on this channel will ensue when questions are posed. Many of you will be cohort mates and colleagues together, so there is no reason to not start working together, which is what tech is really all about anyhow.",
