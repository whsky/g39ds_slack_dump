Everything we do is aimed at making sure our customers love every aspect of Looker, from our products and technologies to our ease of doing business and our support. We are looking for curiously brilliant individuals to join our team as we reinvent data analytics. Get data-driven and see yourself at Looker. WHAT WE'VE GOT GOING ON The engineering team at Looker is a tight-knit group of high-performers. We value simplicity in both our code and our user interfaces. We don\u2019t believe in large teams; we opt for small, diverse groups that move fast, communicate clearly and achieve more. \u00a0We try to choose the right tool for the job, not one tool to solve all problems. We make a huge impact on product direction, we experiment, and we iterate rapidly. Looker is seeking well-rounded Front End and Full Stack Engineers to help build out our cutting-edge data discovery platform. Looker is still a small team, so you\u2019ll have the opportunity to work on many aspects of the product. You should have experience and a proven track record solving moderately complex web engineering problems. Most of all, you should share a love of programming.",
