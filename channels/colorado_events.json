During this hands-on course, you&amp;#39;ll develop a wifi-enabled project that can blast the web with data or be controlled remotely. We&amp;#39;ll cover the basics of what tools are out there to get started (Arduino, Raspberry Pi, Particle), and what you need to make use of them. We&amp;#39;ll then create a project that everyone will complete by the end of the session. Your project will hook up with IFTTT so you can use any internet trigger to activate your device.This workshop is available to the first 23 registrants.",

During this hands-on course, you&amp;#39;ll develop a wifi-enabled project that can blast the web with data or be controlled remotely. We&amp;#39;ll cover the basics of what tools are out there to get started (Arduino, Raspberry Pi, Particle), and what you need to make use of them. We&amp;#39;ll then create a project that everyone will complete by the end of the session. Your project will hook up with IFTTT so you can use any internet trigger to activate your device.This workshop is available to the first 20 registrants.",

These professionals possess skills and experience that the rest of us in the corporate world badly need but are rarely given.\n \nPitchLab is a \u201cPowerPoint Comedy Show\u201d where you'll learn to present everything better.\n \nVolunteers present in front of a live audience to an expert panel that includes a stand-up comedian, improv coach, and professional storyteller.\n \nPresenters get actionable feedback on their delivery, room command and storytelling, and we all learn by listening in.\n \nWe all need these skills. Whether it's pitching your boss for a raise, giving a sprint demo or presenting to a customer, most of us are required to be professional presenters whether we like it or not.\n\n*LOOKING FOR 3 STUDENT VOLUNTEERS TO PRESENT* \nIf you're interested in being one of the presenters at the event, sign up here: <https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSecCuEqUweOOohPtDGbs5dzUCAWaLdZACAJ5ZrmkiSffQXJNw/viewform?c=0&amp;w=1>",
