The tile might feature a city, a road, a cloister, grassland or some combination thereof, and it must be placed adjacent to tiles that have already been played, in such a way that cities are connected to cities, roads to roads, etcetera. Having placed a tile, the player can then decide to place one of his meeples on one of the areas on it: on the city as a knight, on the road as a robber, on a cloister as a monk, or on the grass as a farmer. When that area is complete, that meeple scores points for its owner. During a game of Carcassonne, players are faced with decisions like: &amp;quot;Is it really worth putting my last meeple there?&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;Should I use this tile to expand my city, or should I place it near my opponent instead, giving him a hard time to complete his project and score points?&amp;quot; Since players place only one tile and have the option to place one meeple on it, turns proceed quickly even if it is a game full of options and possibilities.",

Players collect cards of various types of train cars they then use to claim railway routes in North America. The longer the routes, the more points they earn. Additional points come to those who fulfill Destination Tickets &amp;ndash; goal cards that connect distant cities; and to the player who builds the longest continuous route. &amp;quot;The rules are simple enough to write on a train ticket &amp;ndash; each turn you either draw more cards, claim a route, or get additional Destination Tickets,&amp;quot; says Ticket to Ride author, Alan R. Moon. &amp;quot;The tension comes from being forced to balance greed &amp;ndash; adding more cards to your hand, and fear &amp;ndash; losing a critical route to a competitor.&amp;quot; Ticket to Ride continues in the tradition of Days of Wonder's big format board games featuring high-quality illustrations and components including: an oversize board map of North America, 225 custom-molded train cars, 144 illustrated cards, and wooden scoring markers. Since its introduction and numerous subsequent awards, Ticket to Ride has become the BoardGameGeek epitome of a &amp;quot;gateway game&amp;quot; -- simple enough to be taught in a few minutes, and with enough action and tension to keep new players involved and in the game for the duration.
