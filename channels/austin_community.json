(It's FREE - if you print them out) (they're currently sold out :[ )\n\nHere's why they are awesome / why we use them. We work with our alumni a lot and we sure do have a bunch of them so we've been exploring what other resources we can implement to 1.) Solve bandwidth issues in providing students with access to technical talent and 2.) elevate the technical ability of all of us and  3.) Help elevate our students and get them employed!!\n\n\n*More Fun Resources:*\n\n<https://codekingdoms.com/> - kids learn to code by playing minecraft\n\n<http://www.codecards.io/> - amazing flashcards for WDI\n\n<http://littlecodr.com/> - code cards (for kids)\n\n<https://varianto25.com/playing-cards> - regular playing cards with code on them\n\n<https://www.pramp.com/> - Practice technical interviews\n\n<https://interviewing.io/> - Practice technical interviews",

Here's what he says (and he's past US military): There is actually a huge demand right now for foreign development talent in Ukraine as the companies there are trying to make themselves a bit more \"international\" and expand to outside markets.\n\nThe salaries are definitely not what they are here in the U.S. but they are more than enough to have an amazing life in Ukraine.  Also, there are several cities which are amazing (including my home city of Lviv) which are quite safe and provide plenty of career and personal opportunities for the adventurous technomad.  I myself am originally from Seattle, but have been living in Lviv for 5 years and have a wife and kid there so I can attest to its safety and standard of living.",

Travelers are forced to use un-evolved search methods, navigating through a tremendous amount of information online before finding the perfect option that matches their trip needs. A one-size-fits-all approach doesn\u2019t work anymore; users desire a more personalized experience.\u00a0 WayBlazer travel intelligence provides the most relevant recommendations for destinations and travel products for every traveler.\u00a0 By ingesting and merging millions of pieces of unstructured and structured data points, the WayBlazer Travel Graph understands destinations, hotels, cruises, tours, and travelers the same way travel experts would - considering both context and intent. Using machine learning, WayBlazer's Travel Graph gets smarter every day by continuously optimizing new data inputs. The end result is a travel recommendation engine that makes travel search, discovery, and planning a more engaging and personalized experience. Andrei Faji Andrei Faji is the Head of Marketing at WayBlazer, a B2B artificial intelligence startup transforming the travel industry. He oversees the company\u2019s creative direction, brand development, and product marketing. Born in Romania, Andrei has spent the last decade working in various roles focused on brand development, strategic partnerships, and creative direction. His love for travel, technology, and storytelling has inspired his career from marketing luxury tree houses in Costa Rica to startups in San Francisco. Andrei currently lives in Austin with his wife, who\u2019s an artist. To fuel his inspiration he can be found adventure traveling, collecting rare vinyls, and reading biographies. Carter Brooking Carter Brooking is the Director of Engineering at WayBlazer, a B2B artificial intelligence startup transforming the travel industry. His team works on systems to understand the travel world using machine learning, data analysis, chat bots, natural language processing and other modern tools.

His main software love is data and querying it efficiently. Carter lives in Austin with his wife and two children. When he finds free time he enjoys doing astronomy with his telescope and cooking new dishes (especially if they involve using a sous vide).",

We are also proud have launched The Galvanize Standard earlier this year, making our placement process and information even more transparent for both current and prospective students. To that end, we have an immediate ask/action-item of you.\n\nThe United States Bureau of Labor Statistics publishes a list of Standard Occupational Classification (SOC) codes, categorizing all jobs for the purpose of collecting, calculating, or disseminating employment data. Moving forward, we will be disclosing all Standard Occupational Classification (SOC) codes that pertain to Galvanize programs - ensuring that we are supporting our student\u2019s career transformation and being transparent regarding the roles for which the Galvanize programs prepare students. This is also compliant with the State of California\u2019s Bureau for Private Postsecondary Education recently revised regulations (addendum with Codes attached), asking schools to communicate the explicit SOC codes applicable to their programs, and asking students to acknowledge receipt of these codes. We will be integrating the SOC codes into the Student Catalog for all current and incoming students, and you can expect to receive the addendum via Docusign in your inbox within the next 24 hours. \n\nBy reviewing the SOC codes and signing this form, you ensure that Galvanize is able to responsibly collect, report, and communicate placement data. This information is critical for prospective students to accurately assess our program, and we thank you for your support! \n\nPlease feel free to reach out to our Director of Career Services, Jessica Thrasher, at <mailto:jessica.thrasher@galvanize.com|jessica.thrasher@galvanize.com>, or me with any questions or concerns. \n\nHappy Holidays! -sg",
