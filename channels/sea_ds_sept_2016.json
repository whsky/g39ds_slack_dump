My capstone project involves finding personality traits of cities in Europe, and I\u2019m (hopefully) validating it by surveying people about their experiences in a subset of the cities.

The cities included are Paris, Rome, London, Dublin, Krakow, Berlin, Barcelona, Brussels, Amsterdam, and Munich, and you can skip the cities that you haven\u2019t been to.

It would have to be reactive enough to gauge the sentiment of a person each day and the weighting of predictors would need to slide as different things become relevant on any given day. Those would likely be driven by some kind subordinate process that would profile social traffic.

If they are not normalized to be of unit length, then, those with the largest dot products will generally point to the same location in space while those with the smallest dot products will generally be orthogonal, however due to the interplay between the cosine of the angles and the magnitudes, it is harder to say directly which are the most similar; maybe we should then use some sort of a combination of cosine measure and distance, normalized in some way to get similarities between various vectors.",

We are currently in the phase of construction where the walls are being mudded and painted.  To help keep the project on schedule, our construction team has been using large fans to dry the walls.  We recognize the fans are noisy.  We have worked with our construction team the fans can be shut off around 9am each morning.  At this time, we anticipate this phase of our construction will last one more week.  We hope to have the fans removed from both floors by Friday, October 7th.  Again we thank you for your patience!   If you have any questions or concerns, please reach out to any gSeattle Team Member!  \n\nThank you!\"",

They are actively hiring data scientists. The company builds software products to support the religious community and theological study, but there is no requirement of religious affiliation to work there. They came and spoke with our web development students and grads and it seemed like a pretty cool company. If you are interested, please respond with an emoji of your choice. Chat will be at 3:30pm on Friday 9/30 in the lumber yard (4th floor conference room). Let me know if you have questions.",

This meetup is for anyone using or learning python in any capacity. The meetings are typically large, have good food, good speakers and great company. There are only a couple spots left, so go ahead and reserve one if you want to go.\n<https://www.meetup.com/PSPPython/events/233746321/>\n\nOn Thursday there are two meetups. There is a weekly PuPPy programming night where about 20 people get together and work on or socialize about whatever projects they are working on. This is a great way to make a more personal connection with some of the people in the community, and it takes place in Galvanize.\n<https://www.meetup.com/PSPPython/events/233800387/>\n\nAlso on Thursday there is a meetup for Seattle Data Science here in Galvanize. I know less about this group, but it should be a good place to meet data scientist in the community.\n<https://www.meetup.com/Seattle-Data-Science/events/232932405/>",
