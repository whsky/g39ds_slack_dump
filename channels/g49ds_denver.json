My name is Jordan.  I grew up in Ohio (just south of Cleveland) but have been in Denver since 2011.  I am most looking forward to really getting back into data.  It was a passion of mine for a long time, but my career took me down a different path.  So I am excited to realign with a new career that energizes me. My hobbies outside of r/dataisbeautiful are all the reasons I moved to Colorado in the first place: hiking, camping/backpacking, snowboarding, and drinking good beer. :hula:",

We are excited to meet you soon. \n\nRegarding the prework: We _just_ moved everything over to <http://learn.galvanize.com|learn.galvanize.com> &amp; g49 is the first Denver DSI cohort to get early access to it! Please complete your prework in Learn instead of GitHub. In order to access Learn, you\u2019ll need to accept the invite which is sent via email after you\u2019ve signed your contract. The pre-course Cohort name in Learn is 17-01-DS-OL-PC (aka DSI Precourse). If you are having access issues, please email <mailto:softwaresupport@galvanize.com|softwaresupport@galvanize.com> with a detailed description of your problem. You\u2019ll still use GitHub throughout the program so it\u2019s good to be on there now too. Post any questions here or feel free to DM myself, <@U1Z90HJG3> (Adam Richards), or <@U1WHHHQ7N> (Frank Burkholder) ! \n\nIn the meantime, share some information about yourself here! Where are you from? Are you moving to Denver for the program? What are you most looking forward to? What are your hobbies (outside of analyzing data &amp; solving complicated stats problems of course)? Post your intro here with the coolest emoji to you can find. :ramsay:",
