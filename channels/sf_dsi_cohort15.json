Unearthed is a 54 hour hackathon event featuring challenges and data from global mining and resources companies. Those challenges and datasets are current industry problems that have been sourced from different corners of the world and are million and billion dollar projects. This means that even the smallest amount of improvement that a participant at the Unearthed hackathon can make on a particular challenge/dataset will have massive efficiency gains. Challenge providers BHP Billiton and Caterpillar are looking for the brightest young innovators and entrepreneurs to come in and solve their challenges. To put it into perspective, BHP Billiton operates the world\u2019s largest private heavy haul network in the world, each iron ore train on average contains over 230 ore cars carrying 34+ thousand tons of ore worth over $2 million dollars. Every minute of lost time is equivalent to over $28,000. \n\nUnearthed is looking to invite software developers and data scientists to its hackathon event to build solutions to those challenges. This is an opportunity like no other and Unearthed is pleased to offer 15 Galvanize alumni with free tickets to #UnearthedSF.\nAll you need to do is go to the registration page <http://bit.ly/UESF16> and use the code GalvanizeDS100 to get your free ticket.\nThis code is limited to the first 15 people that get in, so don\u2019t miss out!",

FAQ'sCan I come ready as a team? Can I participate as an individual? I don't have a team, but still wish to come along, can I do so?We recommend that you work as a team. We have found the most successful team size is between 3 to 4, but teams can be more or less. If you don\u2019t have a team then we\u2019ll help you to form one at the info session or on the opening evening.When is the Info Session? A live streamed Info Session will be held approximately one week before Unearthed San Francisco 2016. The Unearthed crew will live stream the Info Session from Australia. Exact details will be announced closer to the event\u00a0 via email, social media and on our website. Follow Unearthed on social media links to be kept informed.I won\u2019t be able to make it for the full weekend, can I still come? If you are unable to make one of the days/nights, that\u2019s OK. Just let us know or let your team members know beforehand. If you haven\u2019t formed a team yet and cannot make the Friday night, drop us an email and we\u2019ll try to put you in a team so that you\u2019re ready on Saturday.What is the cost? And what does it involve?Innovator tickets are for the full weekend. This includes breakfast, lunch, dinner, coffees and drinks all weekend! It also includes industry mentoring and tech startup experts.When will the challenges be released? Can we start working earlier?Descriptions of the challenges will be released the week before the event. All code, design and assets must be created during the hackathon or be freely available to the public (open source). Attend the info session prior to the hackathon in order to get prepared.Who owns what we make at the event?All teams retain full ownership of what is created during the event, barring any prior agreements you might have with employers, universities, etc... You own 100% of the IP that you create.What are the types of skills I need to have in my team to succeed at Unearthed? Unearthed recommends that your team consist of a mix of individuals who each bring different skills to the event. At least one programmer/developer (open source), a data scientist (number cruncher), a designer (can make the tech look amazing) and perhaps an entrepreneur with a business mind who can think of your project in terms of its value and market position. Other backgrounds include engineering and geology, depending on the challenge that your team selects at the event.",
