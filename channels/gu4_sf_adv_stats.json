                    "text": "I have a little secret: I don&rsquo;t like the terminology, notation, and style of writing in statistics. I find it unnecessarily complicated. This shows up when trying to read about Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods. Take, for example, the abstract to the Markov Chain Monte Carlo article in the Encyclopedia of Biostatistics.\nMarkov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) is a technique for estimating by simulation the expectation of a statistic in a complex model. Successive random selections form a Markov chain, the stationary distribution of which is the target distribution. It is particularly useful for the evaluation of posterior distributions in complex Bayesian models. In the Metropolis&ndash;Hastings algorithm, items are selected from an arbitrary &ldquo;proposal&rdquo; distribution and are retained or not according to an acceptance rule. The Gibbs sampler is a special case in which the proposal distributions are conditional distributions of single components of a vector parameter. Various special cases and applications are considered.\nI can only vaguely understand what the author is saying here (and really only because I know ahead of time what MCMC is). There are certainly references to more advanced things than what I&rsquo;m going to cover in this post. But it seems very difficult to find an explanation of Markov Chain Monte Carlo without&nbsp;superfluous&nbsp;jargon. The &ldquo;bullshit&rdquo; here is the&nbsp;implicit claim of an author that such jargon is needed. Maybe it is to explain advanced applications (like attempts to do &ldquo;inference in&nbsp;Bayesian networks&rdquo;), but it is certainly not needed to define or analyze the basic&nbsp;ideas.\nSo to counter,&nbsp;here&rsquo;s my own explanation of Markov Chain Monte Carlo,&nbsp;inspired by the treatment of John Hopcroft and Ravi Kannan.\nThe Problem is&nbsp;Drawing from a Distribution\nMarkov Chain Monte Carlo is a technique to solve&nbsp;the problem of&nbsp;sampling from a complicated distribution.&nbsp;Let me explain by&nbsp;the following imaginary scenario. Say I have a magic box which can estimate probabilities of baby&nbsp;names very well. I can give it a string&nbsp;like &ldquo;Malcolm&rdquo; and it will tell me the exact probability  that you will choose this name for&nbsp;your next&nbsp;child.&nbsp;So there&rsquo;s a distribution  over all names, it&rsquo;s very specific to your preferences, and&nbsp;for the sake of argument say this distribution is fixed and you don&rsquo;t get to tamper with it.\nNow comes the problem: I want to efficiently&nbsp;draw&nbsp;a name from this distribution . This is the problem that Markov Chain Monte Carlo aims to solve. Why is it a problem? Because&nbsp;I have no idea what process you use to pick a name, so I can&rsquo;t simulate&nbsp;that&nbsp;process myself. Here&rsquo;s another method you could try: generate a name  uniformly at random, ask the machine for , and then flip a biased coin with probability  and use  if the coin lands heads. The problem with this is that there are exponentially many names! The variable here is the number of bits needed to write down a name . So&nbsp;either&nbsp;the probabilities  will be exponentially&nbsp;small and I&rsquo;ll be flipping for a very long time to get a single name, or else there will only be a few names with nonzero probability and it will take me exponentially many draws to find them. Inefficiency is the death of me.\nSo this is a serious problem! Let&rsquo;s restate it formally just to be clear.\nDefinition (The sampling problem):&nbsp;&nbsp;Let  be a distribution over a finite set . You are given&nbsp;black-box access to the probability distribution function  which&nbsp;outputs the probability of drawing&nbsp; according to&nbsp;. Design an efficient randomized algorithm  which outputs&nbsp;an element&nbsp;of&nbsp; so that the probability of outputting  is approximately&nbsp;. More generally, output a sample of elements from  drawn according to .\nAssume that  has access to only fair random coins, though this allows one to efficiently simulate flipping a&nbsp;biased coin of any desired probability.\nNotice that with such an algorithm we&rsquo;d be able to do things like estimate the expected value of some random variable . We could take a large sample  via the solution to the sampling problem, and then compute the average value of  on that sample. This is what a Monte Carlo method does when sampling is easy. In fact, the Markov Chain&nbsp;solution to the sampling problem will allow us to do the sampling and the estimation of  in one fell swoop if you want.\nBut&nbsp;the core problem&nbsp;is really a sampling problem, and &ldquo;Markov Chain Monte Carlo&rdquo; would be more accurately called the &ldquo;Markov Chain Sampling Method.&rdquo; So let&rsquo;s see why a Markov Chain could possibly help us.\nRandom Walks, the &ldquo;Markov Chain&rdquo; part of MCMC\nMarkov Chain is essentially a fancy term for a random walk on a graph.\nYou give me a directed graph , and for each edge  you give me a number . In order to make a random walk make sense, the &nbsp;need to satisfy the following constraint:\nFor any vertex , the set all values &nbsp;on outgoing edges  must sum to 1, i.e. form a probability distribution.\nIf this is satisfied then we can take a random walk on  according to the probabilities as follows: start at some vertex . Then pick an outgoing edge at random according to the probabilities on the outgoing edges, and follow it to .&nbsp;Repeat if possible.\nI say &ldquo;if possible&rdquo; because an arbitrary graph will not necessarily have any outgoing edges from a given vertex. We&rsquo;ll need to impose some additional conditions on&nbsp;the graph in order to apply random walks to Markov Chain Monte Carlo, but in any case the idea&nbsp;of randomly walking is well-defined, and we call the whole object  a&nbsp;Markov chain.\nHere is an example where the vertices in the graph correspond to emotional states.\nAn example Markov chain; image source  statistics land, they&nbsp;take the &ldquo;state&rdquo; interpretation of a random walk very seriously. They call the edge probabilities &ldquo;state-to-state transitions.&rdquo;\nThe main theorem we need to do anything useful with Markov chains is the stationary distribution theorem (sometimes called the &ldquo;Fundamental Theorem of Markov Chains,&rdquo; and for good reason). What it says intuitively is that for a very long random walk, the probability that you end at some vertex  is independent of where you started!&nbsp;All of these probabilities taken together is called the stationary distribution&nbsp;of the random walk, and it is uniquely determined by the Markov chain.\nHowever, for the reasons we stated above (&ldquo;if possible&rdquo;), the&nbsp;stationary distribution theorem is not true of every Markov chain. The main property we need is&nbsp;that the graph  is&nbsp;strongly connected. Recall that a directed graph is called connected if, when you ignore direction, there is a path from every vertex to every other vertex. It is called&nbsp;strongly connected if you still get paths everywhere when considering direction. If we additionally require the&nbsp;stupid edge-case-catcher that no edge can have zero probability, then strong connectivity (of one component of a graph) is equivalent to the following property:\nFor every vertex , an infinite random walk started at &nbsp;will return to  with probability 1.\nIn fact it will return infinitely often. This property is called the&nbsp;persistence&nbsp;of the state  by statisticians. I dislike&nbsp;this term because it appears to describe a property of a&nbsp;vertex, when&nbsp;to me&nbsp;it describes a property of the connected component containing that vertex. In any case, since in Markov Chain Monte Carlo we&rsquo;ll&nbsp;be picking&nbsp;the graph&nbsp;to walk on&nbsp;(spoiler!) we will ensure the graph&nbsp;is strongly connected by design.\nFinally, in order to describe the stationary distribution in a more familiar mann\u2026",

It is based on Bayesian inference to interpret the observations/data acquired during the experiment. This allows accounting for both any prior knowledge on the parameters to be determined as well as uncertainties in observations.\nThe theory of Bayesian experimental design is to a certain extent based on the theory for making optimal decisions under uncertainty. The aim when designing an experiment is to maximize the expected utility of the experiment outcome. The utility is most commonly defined in terms of a measure of the accuracy of the information provided by the experiment (e.g. the Shannon information or the negative variance), but may also involve factors such as the financial cost of performing the experiment. What will be the optimal experiment design depends on the particular utility criterion chosen.",

Any of several possible divergence measures can be chosen, for example the Kullback-Leibler divergence or the Hellinger distance. By maximizing the divergence, we allow the data to have the maximum effect on the posterior estimates.\n\nsource:",

He is most famous for his &ldquo;evolutionary fitness&rdquo; approach to training and diet, and our conversation focuses on that.\nDuring his time at UCLA, Art did many things, including creating mathematical and statistical models to precisely describe the motion picture market. Art is Professor Emeritus of Economics of the University of California, Irvine, and is a member of its acclaimed Institute for Mathematical Behavioral Sciences.\nA lifelong student of metabolism and fitness, Art has lived as a Paleo athlete for more than thirty years and is considered a &ldquo;patriarch&rdquo; of the Paleo movement.\nHe believes there is no such thing as &ldquo;healthy&rdquo; aging and that we can intervene to protect against the aging process. In this episode, we talk about his daily schedule, workout routines, why he never gets sick, ice ages, economics, philosophies of intermittent everything, and really dig into the details of a fascinating man.\nEnjoy!\n\nThis embed is invalid\nListen to it on iTunes.\nStream by clicking here.\nDownload as an MP3 by right-clicking&nbsp;here and choosing &ldquo;save as.&rdquo;\nWant&nbsp;to hear another episode from a guest that defies aging?&nbsp;&mdash; Listen to&nbsp;this interview with Jerzy Gregorek.

I reached out to these Finnish entrepreneurs after a very talented acrobat introduced me to one of their products, which blew my mind (in the best way possible). It is mushroom coffee featuring chaga. It tastes like coffee, but there are only 40 milligrams of caffeine, so it has less than half of what you would find in a regular cup of coffee. I do not get any jitters, acid reflux, or any type of stomach burn. It put me on fire for an entire day, and I only had half of the packet.\nPeople are always asking me what I use for cognitive enhancement right now &mdash; this is the answer. You can try it right now by going to  and using the code Tim to get 20 percent off your first order. If you are in the experimental mindset, I do not think you&rsquo;ll be disappointed.\nThis podcast is also brought to you by Audible. I have used Audible for years, and I love audiobooks.
