It turns out I\u2019ve got an impacted wisdom tooth - normally they could just yank it, but the oral surgeon looked at my 2d x-ray and was concerned the tooth might be right on top of a nerve, which would complicate things.  I just got back from getting a CT scan at a different place, and am just waiting to hear from the surgeon - really hoping they can squeeze me in today, but I\u2019m scheduled for tomorrow at 2:30, and it sounds like they won\u2019t even be able to do the surgery at that time, as it\u2019s just a \u2018consultation\u2019, and any surgery would have to go down at a separate appointment. \n\n I\u2019m in some serious pain right now and definitely can\u2019t make it in today, but they threw me on antibiotics and gave me a saline rinse, so I\u2019m hoping it\u2019ll clear up and I\u2019ll be able to come back in ASAP - I guess the pain is just from the infection, so if that clears up I should definitely be able to make it for Thursday and Friday, and can just put the surgery off.",
